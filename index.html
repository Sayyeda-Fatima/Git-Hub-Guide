        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control" target="_blank">Distributed Version
                Control System</a>.
            In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance,
            security and flexibility in mind.<br>
            In this tutorial we will see some important Git commands and concepts that every beginer should know.
            <br><br>
            Let's begin then:

            First of all you will need to
            <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows" target="_balnk">download and
                install</a>
            Git on your computer. Once you have installed git now you can create local repisitories and start your
            version control.
        </p>

        <h2>Importance of Git:</h2>
        <p>
            Git is very important for programmers ass it allows them to save changes in every version and keep a
            histrory of these changes in
            case they want to return to previous version when error occurs. Also it allows user to collebrate with other
            people as all people can have same
            code and will save changes to same repository, so, anyone can see these changes.
        </p>


        <h2>Repository:</h2>
        <p>The first and most common concept of Git is repositories. All the file versions are saved in a repository. In
            simple words it is a folder that stores all the version and history of changes in our code.<br><br></p>

        <h2>Creating a Git Repository</h2>
        <p>To create a repository, you can press right click on mouse, press new from the menu and create a folder and
            open
            that folder in Command line terminal. Then we use following command to make a git repository in required
            folder : </p>

        <p class="command"><b>-git init-</b></p><br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/creating a folder.png" alt="creating a folder image here" height="30%" width="40%">
        </div>

        <p>After creating the folder open it and again press right click on mouse. Choose <b>"Open in terminal"</b> from
            menu. It will open a command line prompt in your folder. Now you can write <b>" git init "</b> command and
            initialize a git repository in that folder.</p><br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/open in terminal.png" alt="open in terminal image here" height="70%"
                width="100%"><br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git init.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>Now we have succesfully initialized a git repository in our folder. When we intialize a git repository in a
            folder a <b>" .git "</b> folder is created in our original folder and that .git folder is our repository but
            is
            hidden mostly.</p>

        <h2>Staging area:</h2>
        <p>
            Staging area is a temporary place where every file that we want to add to our repository must stay before
            commiting it to
            repository. It lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur. We can add our files to git
            staging area by using command:
        </p>

        <p class="command"><b>-git add-</b></p>

        <p>We can use git add command with '.' to add all files to staging area or we can give name of the file to add
            to staging area.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git add..png" alt="git add image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">or</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git add filename.png" alt="git add filename image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>To see if our files are added to staging area or not, or even to see status or condition of our repository at
            anytime we use
            <b style="color: red; font-size: 150%">-git status-</b> command.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status.png" alt="git status image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>Here the green files show that they are currently in staging area. If we modify a file it will show in red
            which means that we need to add those files to staging area e.g:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status2.png" alt="git status2 image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
            In the above example you can see that when we change in file1.txt it shows in red and have a status of
            modified.
            Now we have to again -git add- to add to staging area.
        </p>

        <h2>Commiting Files to Repository</h2>
        <p>Here we need to remember that -git add- only adds our files to staging area and not to our repository
            directly. To
            add our files from staging area to repository, we use following command:
        </p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git commit -m ""-</b></p>

        <p>Where <b style="color: rgb(9, 103, 9);">-m</b> is used to add a appropriate message to our commit.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git commit.png" alt="git commit image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>Now if we use -git status- it will show us that our reposoitory is up to date and there are no new or
            modified files in our
            staging area to be commited.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status commit.png" alt="git status commit image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>As we can see on -git status- it tells us that there is noting to commit.</p>

        <h2>Branches:</h2>
        <p>
            Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or
            fix a bug —no
            matter how big or how small— you create a new branch to encapsulate your changes so that if that new feautre
            or code create
            some fatal error your original code is still safe in your main branch. <br>
            You can use following command to see branches in your repository:
        </p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git branch-</b></p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git branch.png" alt="git barnch image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>The star symbol in the start of branch name shows that it the current working branch, means all the changes
            will be stored to this branch.
            Branch <span style="color: rgba(44, 149, 24, 0.758);">master</span> is made by default when we initiate our
            repository and work as our main branch.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating a new branch:</h3>
        <p>To create a new branch we use following command:</p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git checkout -b name-</b></p>
        <p>where name is the name of new branch. <br><br> Here we use <b>-git checkout-</b> command to move to new
            branch and <b>-b</b> attribute is used to create new
            branch and then move to it.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git chekout.png" alt="git checkout image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see we have created new branches and are now currently at branch3.
            <br><span style="color: red;"> Important Note:</span> All these branches will have same code, as master
            branch, on creation.
            <br>
        <h3>Moving to another branch:</h3>
        Now if you want to move back to master branch or some other branch you can use -git checkout- without -b
        attribute:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git checkout2.png" alt="git checkout2 here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Git Hub</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have learned some of the basic it we can now learn about <b>Git Hub</b>, a platform for version
            control. <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/">Git Hub</a> is a online platform that helps programmers to manage repositories
            online.
        </p>
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account"
            style="font-size: 15px;">How to create a Git Hub account</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo" style="font-size: 15px;">How to create
            a repository on Git Hub</a>

        <p>The repositories on Git Hub are refferd to as remote repositories. We can push data from our local repository
            on our device to our remote repository on Git Hub.</p>

        <h3>How to Push to Remote Reposoitory</h3>
        <p>To push data to remote repository we first need to link our local repository to our remote repository on Git
            Hub. To do this we use following command:</p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git remote add origin url-</b></p>
        <p>where url is the url link of your repository.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/linking repo.png" alt="linking repo image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>Now to push files to our remote repository we use command:</p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git push -u origin main-</b></p>
        <p>where main is name of master branch.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/rename master.png" alt="rename master image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>We use main as Git Hub do not allow to push masrter branch.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git push.png" alt="git push image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>Now your local repository is saved to your Git Hub repository.<br><br>Notice that you have to push to your
            remote repository every time you commit so your cahnges will be saved to local repository too.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>And this is how programmers can keep record of code progress and collaborate with each other easily using git
            and git hub.</p>
