        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control" target="_blank">Distributed Version
                Control System</a>.
            In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance,
            security and flexibility in mind.<br>
            In this tutorial we will see some important Git commands and concepts that every beginer should know.
            <br><br>
            Let's begin then:

            First of all you will need to
            <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows" target="_balnk">download and
                install</a>
            Git on your computer. Once you have installed git now you can create local repisitories and start your
            version control.
        </p>

        <h2>Importance of Git:</h2>
        <p>
            Git is very important for programmers ass it allows them to save changes in every version and keep a
            histrory of these changes in
            case they want to return to previous version when error occurs. Also it allows user to collebrate with other
            people as all people can have same
            code and will save changes to same repository, so, anyone can see these changes.
        </p>


        <h2>Repository:</h2>
        <p>The first and most common concept of Git is repositories. All the file versions are saved in a repository. In
            simple words it is a folder that stores all the version and history of changes in our code.<br><br></p>

        <h2>Creating a Git Repository</h2>
        <p>To create a repository, you can press right click on mouse, press new from the menu and create a folder and
            open
            that folder in Command line terminal. Then we use following command to make a git repository in required
            folder : </p>

        <p class="command"><b>-git init-</b></p><br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/creating a folder.png" alt="creating a folder image here" height="30%" width="40%">
        </div>

        <p>After creating the folder open it and again press right click on mouse. Choose <b>"Open in terminal"</b> from
            menu. It will open a command line prompt in your folder. Now you can write <b>" git init "</b> command and
            initialize a git repository in that folder.</p><br>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/open in terminal.png" alt="open in terminal image here" height="70%"
                width="100%"><br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git init.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>Now we have succesfully initialized a git repository in our folder. When we intialize a git repository in a
            folder a <b>" .git "</b> folder is created in our original folder and that .git folder is our repository but
            is
            hidden mostly.</p>

        <h2>Staging area:</h2>
        <p>
            Staging area is a temporary place where every file that we want to add to our repository must stay before
            commiting it to
            repository. It lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur. We can add our files to git
            staging area by using command:
        </p>

        <p class="command"><b>-git add-</b></p>

        <p>We can use git add command with '.' to add all files to staging area or we can give name of the file to add
            to staging area.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git add..png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">or</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git add filename.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>To see if our files are added to staging area or not, or even to see status or condition of our repository at
            anytime we use
            <b style="color: red; font-size: 150%">-git status-</b> command.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>Here the green files show that they are currently in staging area. If we modify a file it will show in red
            which means that we need to add those files to staging area e.g:
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status2.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
            In the above example you can see that when we change in file1.txt it shows in red and have a status of modified. 
            Now we have to again -git add- to add to staging area.
        </p>

        <h2>Commiting Files to Repository</h2>
        <p>Here we need to remember that -git add- only adds our files to staging area and not to our repository directly. To
            add our files from staging area to repository, we use following command:
        </p>
        <p class="command"><b>-git commit -m ""-</b></p>

        <p>Where <b style="color: rgb(9, 103, 9);">-m</b> is used to add a appropriate message to our commit.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git commit.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>Now if we use -git status- it will show us that our reposoitory is up to date and there are no new or modified files in our 
            staging area to be commited.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="resources/git status commit.png" alt="git init image here" height="50%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>As we can see on -git status- it tells us that there is noting to commit.</p>

    </div>
